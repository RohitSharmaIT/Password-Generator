## Tech Stack

**HTML:** The project's user interface was built using HTML, which is a markup language used for creating web pages.

**CSS:**  The project's styles were implemented using CSS, which is a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.

**JavsScript:** The project's functionality was implemented using JavaScript, which is a programming language used for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.


## Usage

Once you access the application, you will see a user interface where you can choose the length of your password and select the types of characters you want to include in the password. You can choose from uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Once you have made your selections, click the "Generate Password" button, and the application will generate a strong and secure password for you. You can then copy the password and use it for your desired purpose.


## Documentation

I learned web development through various online resources, including Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp, and Udemy courses. I also attended local meetups and workshops to connect with other developers and learn from their experiences.

To create this password generator, I used my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I learned through these resources. I also consulted various online forums and documentation to overcome any challenges I encountered during the development process.

Overall, my passion for coding and a willingness to learn allowed me to develop the skills necessary to create this project.
